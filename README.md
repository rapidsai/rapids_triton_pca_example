# The RAPIDS-Triton Backend Template

This template repo offers a starting place for those wishing to create a Triton
backend with
[RAPIDS-Triton](https://github.com/rapidsai/rapids-triton). For an example of
how to use this template with detailed commentary, check out the [Linear
Example](https://github.com/rapidsai/rapids-triton-linear-example) repo. 

Throughout the repo, you will find comments labeled `TODO(template)`,
indicating places where you will need to insert your own code or make changes.
Working through each of these should allow you to  create a working Triton
backend.
